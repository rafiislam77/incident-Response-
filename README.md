# Incident Response Playbook 
## Purpose and Scope
### Purpose
This incident response plan exists to ensure Nova Scotia Power is prepared to manage cyber incidents effectively and efficiently. Cybersecurity incidents are increasingly frequent and sophisticated, posing a serious risk to organizations worldwide. Nova Scotia Power is not immune to such threats and must be equipped to detect, prevent, and respond to incidents. By having a structured plan, a trained team, and conducting regular exercises, we will be better prepared to respond to inevitable incidents, minimizing potential damage and mitigating further risks to our organization. Resources must be deployed in an organized manner, utilizing exercised skills and clear communication strategies (Government of Canada, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Office of the Deputy Minister, Digital Transformation Service Sector & Digital Transformation Service Sector, 2021d).<br>
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for responding to cybersecurity incidents at Nova Scotia Power. It identifies the incident response structure, roles, responsibilities, common types of incidents, and the steps for preparing, identifying, containing, eradicating, recovering, and conducting lessons learned, all aimed at minimizing the impact of cybersecurity incidents.
The goal of this incident response plan is to ensure Nova Scotia Power is organized to respond to cybersecurity incidents both effectively and efficiently.
### Scope
This incident response plan applies to Nova Scotia Power’s networks, systems, data, and all stakeholders (including employees, contractors, and third-party vendors) who have access to them. Members of the Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (CSIRT) are expected to lead or participate in incident response activities. CSIRT members must familiarize themselves with this plan and be prepared to collaborate with the goal of minimizing the adverse effects on the organization.
This document establishes the incident handling and response capabilities of Nova Scotia Power and outlines the appropriate responses for common cybersecurity incidents.
